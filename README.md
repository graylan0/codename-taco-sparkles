# Codename Taco Sparkles 🌮✨

Welcome to **Codename Taco Sparkles**, a project as unique and intriguing as its name! Inspired by the boundless curiosity and eloquence of Carl Sagan, this README aims to guide you through the cosmos of our code, sprinkled with stardust and a touch of whimsy. Let's embark on this interstellar journey together! 🚀

## Overview 🌌

_Codename Taco Sparkles_ is not just a project; it's a constellation of ideas, each shining bright in the vast universe of programming. At its core, it's a sophisticated chat application, but look closer, and you'll see it's much more. It's a fusion of speech recognition, natural language processing, and the wisdom of the digital cosmos, all coming together to create something truly magical.

## Features 🌟

- **Speech Recognition**: Like a radio telescope picking up signals from distant galaxies, our app listens to the user's voice and deciphers the hidden messages. 🎙️🌠

- **Llama Chatbot**: A chatbot as wise as a llama and as vast as the universe. It uses the Llama model to generate responses that are out of this world! 🦙🌍

- **DuckDuckGo Integration**: Just as astronomers use telescopes to explore the stars, our app uses DuckDuckGo to fetch data from the depths of the internet. 🦆🔭

- **Weaviate Database**: A database not unlike a cosmic library, holding the knowledge of a thousand worlds, ready to be queried and explored. 📚🌌

- **Eel Web Interface**: A sleek and shiny interface that's as easy to navigate as a spacecraft gliding through the cosmos. 🖥️✨

## Installation 🛠️

To install _Codename Taco Sparkles_, clone this repository to your local machine. Ensure you have Python installed, and then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command is like assembling your spaceship before the launch. It ensures you have all the necessary tools for your journey.

## Usage 🚀

To start the application, simply run:

```bash
python app.py
```

And watch as _Codename Taco Sparkles_ comes to life, ready to take you on an adventure across the digital universe!

## Code Highlights 🌈

### The Heart of the Cosmos: Llama Chatbot

```python
response = llm(full_prompt, max_tokens=900)['choices'][0]['text']
```

Here, like a wizard conjuring spells, our Llama model weaves words into responses, creating a tapestry of dialogue that's both engaging and enlightening.

### The Ears of the Galaxy: Speech Recognition

```python
audio_data = await asyncio.to_thread(recognizer.listen, mic, timeout=1)
```

With the patience of a cosmic listener, our app captures your voice, turning sound waves into stardust from which we craft our replies.

### The Oracle's Vision: DuckDuckGo Integration

```python
results = [r for r in ddgs.text(query, max_results=max_results)]
```

Like an oracle gazing into a crystal ball, our DuckDuckGo integration scours the internet, seeking answers to your most pressing questions.
